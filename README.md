# Statistical-Model-Predicting-survival-on-the-Titanic-Cruise-Ship-

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, the first challenge  to dive into ML competitions.

The repository uses machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

I predicted if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. The dataset was picked from a Kaggle competition, in which for each data point in the test set, I predicted a 0 or 1 value for survivability. I did this prediction with the help of the Logistic Regression model. I manipulated dataset by converting categorical variables to binary variables, performed one-hot encoding, and did feature selection with the help of heatmap plots. In the end, I evaluated the model through a confusion matrix and k-fold cross-validation
